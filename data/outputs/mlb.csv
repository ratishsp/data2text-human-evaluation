1738#0#1,"CLEVELAND -- Francisco Lindor skipped down the third-base line , crossed home plate and suddenly could n't breathe . He was n't alone . Lindor connected for a three - run homer with two outs in the ninth inning as the Cleveland Indians again moved 10 games ahead of Minnesota in the AL Central with a 5 - 2 win over the Twins on Wednesday night . Lindor , who struck out with the winning run at second base in the ninth to end a 3 - 2 loss on Tuesday , drove the first pitch from Trevor Hildenberger ( 2 - 3 ) over the wall in right to trigger a wild celebration . As the Progressive Field crowd roared as if it was October , the All-Star shortstop pointed and waved to the fans before being swarmed by his teammates , including pitcher Carlos Carrasco who emptied most of a bottle of white baby power on him . Down 2 - 1 , Minnesota tied it in the ninth on Miguel Sano 's leadoff homer against Cody Allen ( 4 - 4 ) , who cost Mike Clevinger a victory and wound up with a blown save and win . Lindor saved him . Jason Kipnis singled with one out in the ninth before Twins right fielder Max Kepler raced back and robbed Yan Gomes of extra bases with a leaping catch before crashing into the padded wall . Brandon Guyer followed with a single to bring up the electrifying Lindor , who has a knack for coming up big in clutch moments . `` You know it 's gon na happen .

Beltre was robbed of a fourth hit when Chone Figgins jumped and pulled down his line drive in the eighth . Hamilton added an RBI groundout in the first inning , his Major League-leading 76th of the season . Seattle was shut out for the 11th time this season -- tied for most in the league with Oakland -- with the only offensive highlight being rookie Jesus Montero snapping a 0 - for - 23 skid with a single in the first inning . Seattle got base runners on Harrison but could never get a clutch two - out hit . The Mariners most promising threat came in the seventh after a one - out single by Michael Saunders and walk to Figgins . But Harrison got Ryan to ground into a double play -- with a nice pick by Michael Young at first base -- to end the threat .",sys0

Nationals manager Dave Martinez protested briefly , but plate umpire Tim Timmons said Rojas had the right of way because the bunt rolled some distance . Martinez said Rojas should have been called out because he had no chance to beat out the bunt , and argued Timmons interpreted the rule wrong . After a single by Brian Anderson loaded the bases , Martinez tried a five - infielder , two - outfielder alignment , bringing in right fielder Bryce Harper . Realmuto foiled the strategy with a pop-fly single down the right-field line that fell beyond the reach of Michael A. Taylor . `` The ball barely is fair . It 's just a tough break . '' The Nationals tied the game in the ninth on Daniel Murphy 's one - out RBI single off Kyle Barraclough . Third baseman Rojas made a diving stop of Taylor 's two - out grounder and threw him out to end the inning and strand a runner at third . Six Miami pitchers allowed only five hits . Brett Graves ( 1 - 1 ) lowered his ERA to 7.84 with a perfect 10th for his first career win . Miami starter Trevor Richards allowed three hits in six scoreless innings and struck out eight . He has an ERA of 0.48 in his past three starts . Washington 's Gio Gonzalez allowed only one run in seven innings but remained winless since May 28 . He matched his season high with 114 pitches .",sys0

346#0#1,"PHILADELPHIA -- Ryan Zimmerman sat on the bench nursing a hamstring injury until he got a chance to create his own Kirk Gibson moment -- on a far lesser stage . Zimmerman hit a go-ahead , two - run homer off Danys Baez in the eighth inning and the Washington Nationals rallied for a 7 - 5 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday . Adam Dunn also connected for the Nationals , who stopped Philadelphia 's five - game winning streak . Chase Utley hit his fourth homer in three games and Shane Victorino also went deep for the Phillies . Trailing 4 - 2 in the eighth , the Nationals scored three off Baez ( 0 - 1 ) to take the lead . Dunn led off with a deep drive to right . After a one - out walk to Ivan Rodriguez , Zimmerman lined an opposite-field shot to right for his first career homer as a pinch hitter . The All-Star third baseman was n't in the starting lineup for the fourth straight game because of a left hamstring injury . `` I think I got around the bases a little better than he did , '' Zimmerman joked when asked if he felt like Gibson . `` I can run around a little bit . '' In Game 1 of the 1988 World Series , a gimpy Gibson stepped in with two outs in the bottom of the ninth and connected for a pinch-hit , game-ending homer against Oakland 's Dennis Eckersley in a 5 - 4 Dodgers win . Gibson , who did n't start because of a strained left knee , limped around the bases in one of the most dramatic finishes in series history . On Jackie Robinson Day in the majors -- all players wore No . 42 -- the Phillies received their 2009 NL championship rings before the game . Philadelphia fell two wins short of repeating as World Series champs last year , losing to the New York Yankees . The Phillies are trying to become the first NL team in 66 years to win three straight pennants . They 're off to a 7 - 2 start . Tyler Clippard ( 2 - 0 ) pitched 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief to earn the win . Matt Capps got the last five outs for his fourth save in four tries , and his first ever longer than one inning . He allowed a solo homer to Victorino in the ninth . Rodriguez hit a two - run single off Ryan Madson in the ninth to give the Nationals a three - run cushion . Called up from Triple-A to replace Garrett Mock in Washington 's rotation , Scott Olsen allowed four runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings . Phillies starter J. A. Happ allowed one unearned run and three hits in 5 1/3 innings . The left-hander had to pitch out of trouble often because he walked six , tying a career high . Olsen pitched well until the sixth . Two-out walks to Jayson Werth and Raul Ibanez loaded the bases . Juan Castro then singled to right for a 3 - 1 lead . A frustrated Olsen slammed his glove and cap in the dugout after being pulled . Clippard walked pinch-hitter Greg Dobbs with the bases loaded to force in Philadelphia 's fourth run . First baseman Ryan Howard 's throwing error after Nyjer Morgan was picked off in the third helped Washington tie it at 1 . Morgan scored on Cristian Guzman 's groundout . Philadelphia 's bullpen had n't allowed a homer in 29 1/3 innings until Dunn hit hits first of the year off Baez .

Miller still beamed after the game like a 20-game winner . Cameron Maybin led off the 10th inning with a home run , lifting the Atlanta Braves to a 2 - 1 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday . Miller , an NL All-Star last month , is only 5 - 9 despite ranking among the league leaders with his 2.43 ERA . He has n't won since May 17 at Miami . The winless streak is Atlanta 's longest since Jo-Jo Reyes went 18 games without a win in 2009 . It was Miller 's 10th start in which he did n't win despite allowing no more than one run -- the most in the majors . Instead of criticizing the lack of offense , he praised the fielders who helped extend the no-hit bid . Michael Bourn , acquired from Cleveland earlier this month , made a diving catch on David Peralta 's drive in foul territory down the left field line in the first . The catch helped Miller survive walks to Ender Inciarte and Aaron Hill to open the game . Leading 1 - 0 , Miller 's no-hit try ended when Nick Ahmed led off the eighth with a bloop single to right field .

He quickly got to show it off , too . Despite going 0 for 4 , Buxton streaked home with the go-ahead run in the ninth inning and the Minnesota Twins beat the Texas Rangers 4 - 3 Sunday and ended a five - game losing streak . Regarded by many as the top prospect in baseball , the 21-year-old Buxton joined the Twins from Double-A . He batted ninth and played center , filling out a depleted Minnesota outfield . Eduardo Escobar opened the Twins ninth with a double . Buxton , picked No . 2 in the 2012 draft , tried to sacrifice but bunted back to Shawn Tolleson ( 1 - 1 ) , who threw out Escobar at third base . Buxton said he had n't sacrificed in a while -- his last one came in 2013 in the Class A Midwest League . With two outs , Eddie Rosario doubled to center and Buxton scored without a play . Twins manager Paul Molitor said the threat of Buxton stealing second -- he had 20 in 59 games this season for Double-A Chattanooga -- could have contributed to Rosario 's success against Tolleson . Buxton had scored a Southern League-high 44 runs when he was called up this weekend . The Twins were missing outfielders Torii Hunter , who was serving his suspension for a uniform-tossing tirade , and injured Aaron Hicks . Casey Fien ( 2 - 2 ) pitched two scoreless innings and Glen Perkins pitched a perfect ninth for his American League-leading 22nd save as the Twins snapped a five - game losing streak . Tolleson had been 8 for 8 in save situations since becoming the Rangers ' closer in mid-May . The Twins ' Brian Dozier opened the game with a home run , his 10th career leadoff shot and third this season . Dozier also doubled to increase his league-leading total of extra-base hits to 36 .

1395#0#4,"KANSAS CITY , Mo . -- Yankees manager Joe Girardi knew he was putting young Chasen Shreve , just recalled from the minor leagues earlier in the day , into just about the most difficult spot possible . Protecting a one - run lead with the bases loaded in the 10th inning in the midst of a playoff chase . Against the reigning World Series champions , no less . For the first time in recent memory , an organization that is all about winning now is hoping to learn whether it has the pieces to win tomorrow . Chasen Shreve closes out an eventful day with a New York Yankees victory . Shreve responded by calmly striking out Kendrys Morales , then retiring Salvador Perez on a fly out , to preserve a 5 - 4 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday night . The Yankees took the lead when Brian McCann and Chase Headley singled off Joakim Soria ( 4 - 6 ) in the 10th . Soria bounced back to strike out Aaron Judge and Tyler Austin , but then walked Brett Gardner before Jacoby Ellsbury lined a go-ahead single off the reliever 's leg for his fourth hit of the night . Dellin Betances ( 3 - 4 ) earned the win with two innings of relief . Morales went deep for the Royals to spur their comeback , then provided the tying sacrifice fly in the eighth inning . Jarrod Dyson and Lorenzo Cain also drove in runs for Kansas City . The Yankees built a 4 - 0 lead off Edinson Volquez on a two - run homer by Aaron Judge and RBI from Ellsbury and Headley by the third inning . But they watched it slowly slip away around a 59-minute rain delay that saturated the soggy turf at Kauffman Stadium . In fact , just about all that could slow down the Yankees ' Masahiro Tanaka was the rain . The right-hander mowed through the first eight batters he faced , extending the streak of 14 2/3 scoreless innings he had twirled in his last two starts . Tanaka did n't allow a hit until a single by Raul Mondesi , who later scored on Dyson 's triple off the top of the wall . Tanaka 's only other mistake came on Morales ' homer in the fourth inning . The rain began falling and the tarp came out after the fifth inning , and the delay was long enough to end Tanaka 's night . He allowed two runs and four hits while striking out four without a walk . The Royals got within 4 - 3 in the sixth inning when Cain slapped an RBI double off Adam Warren , then they coaxed across the tying run in the eighth against Tyler Clippard and Betances . Clippard walked Cain to start the inning . Cain promptly stole second off Betances , and the throw from catcher Gary Sanchez squirted into the outfield , allowing Cain to reach third .

With Jimmy Rollins , Ryan Howard and Chase Utley all out of the lineup , Paul Hoover hit a game-ending RBI single in the 10th inning and the defending World Series champions prepared for their title defense with a 7 - 6 victory over the Florida Marlins on Sunday . Manuel has a couple of pressing issues as the Phillies enter the playoffs for the third straight year . Will he start Cole Hamels or Cliff Lee in the postseason opener against Colorado ? Use Ryan Madson or Brad Lidge as closer ? Is J. A. Happ a starter or reliever ? Manuel will decide soon enough . The Phillies host the Rockies on Wednesday in the opener of their best-of-five division series . Happ , a 12-game winner , pitched only two innings in his 23rd start of the year . The rookie left-hander struck out 10 and tossed a shutout against the Rockies in July , but has valuable experience and success out of the bullpen . Happ has settled into the rotation , but would go back to the bullpen if that 's where he 's needed . Just one RBI shy of 100 , right fielder Jayson Werth started and went 1 for 4 , missing out on the milestone . The crowd erupted in jeers when Werth was intentionally walked with two outs and the winning run on second in the 10th inning . Howard tied Prince Fielder for the NL lead with 141 RBIs and was second in homers with 45 . Center fielder Shane Victorino led the league with 13 triples . A sellout crowd of 45,211 packed Citizens Bank Park for the finale . That brought Philadelphia 's final attendance totals to 73 sellouts and a record 3,600,693 fans . Miguel Cairo homered for the NL East champions , who finished 45 - 36 at home . Chad Durbin ( 2 - 2 ) got the win with one scoreless inning . Hanley Ramirez got the day off and finished with a .342 average to become the first Marlins player to win a batting title . He also is the first NL shortstop to win the batting title since Dick Groat in 1960 . Marlins left fielder Chris Coghlan had three hits to bolster his bid for NL Rookie of the Year . His 113 hits after the All-Star break tied with Juan Pierre ( 2004 ) and Bill Buckner ( 1980 ) for the most in the last 45 years . The Marlins went 87 - 75 under third-year manager Fredi Gonzalez . While Gonzalez was widely praised for keeping the Marlins in wild-card contention until the final weeks with the lowest payroll in baseball , he was forced to respond to a story saying the team may replace him . ESPN.com reported former Mets manager Bobby Valentine , who recently ended a six - year run as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines in Japan 's Pacific League , is in talks about taking a position with the Marlins . Dan Meyer ( 3 - 2 ) took the loss for the Marlins , who finished with a winning record for only the sixth time in franchise history . The Marlins went 84 - 77 last season . The Phillies ( 93 - 69 ) will open the postseason at home for the third consecutive year . They lost in the division series to Colorado in 2007 and kicked off their run to the championship last season -- they were 92 - 70 -- by eliminating Milwaukee .
